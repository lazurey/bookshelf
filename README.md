# Bookshelf
----------

## My idea about it

1. Keep a record for my real bookshelf, what's in it, which books I didn't read yet, which book I've borrowed to others.
2. First time import books from douban.
3. Allow to record books which don't exist in douban
4. All book in one page, so I don't need to create search block.

## First and simplest one
1. Import all books from douban
2. List them in one page
3. Add login / cookie block from the other projects
4. Add a book (title, isbn, status, remark)

## Rules
1. Use pure HTML. No images, no picture. Simple color and simple css.
2. Keep everything include words as simple as possible.

## Remark
1. Now I use my own douban uid for test
2. Need jQuery, now I use one in another project, so I didn't upload it.
